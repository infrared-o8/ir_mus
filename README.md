# Infrared Music

The project began as a personal tool and is now maintained as a public repository.

## What Problem This Solves

Infrared Music was developed to allow me to directly be able to download music without relying on sketchy websites :p


## Features

* Search with suggestion support
* Queue-based download manager with retries
* Single-item, batch, and playlist handling
* File sharing from within the app
* Network controls (e.g., Wi-Fi only)
* Basic settings and preferences (not fully implemented yet, the color themes dont work)
* Built-in update checking via GitHub

## Download

You can download the latest release (apk file) from [Releases](https://github.com/infrared-o8/ir_mus/releases).

## Project Status

The app is under development, although postponed.
Some features (such as advanced settings and accessibility tools/options) are still being expanded.

Bug reports and practical feedback are welcome :D
